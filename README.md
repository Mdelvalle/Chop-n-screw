# Chop-n-screw
My humble attempt at taking any song you want, and [chopping and screwing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopped_and_screwed) it with the help of the wicked cool [Echo Nest Remix!](http://echonest.github.io/remix/)
- Slows down the tempo
- Reduces the pitch

TODO:
-----
- Skipping beats
- Record scratching
- Stop-time

Usage:
------
<pre>python screw.py [input_filename] [output_filename]</pre>

Example: <pre>python screw.py ATLiens.mp3 chopped-n-screwed.mp3</pre>
